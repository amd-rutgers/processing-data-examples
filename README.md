Processing Data Loading Examples
================================

This project contains several examples of how to load data into Processing. The first example shows how to load one-dimensional data from a single text file, the rest show how to load two-dimensional data*. 

1. [Single text file](01_single_txt_file/)
2. [Multiple text files](02_multiple_txt_files/)
3. [Multiple text files in an array](03_multiple_txt_files_array/)
4. [Single CSV file](04_csv_file/)
5. [Single XML file](05_xml_file/)
6. [Single JSON file](06_json_file/)

The sample data I'm using is below:

## Data source

| 3/6 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 |
| 3/7 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 3 |
| 3/8 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 3 |
| 3/9 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 6 |

* One-dimensional data is data that can be fit into one column or row in a spreadsheet, two-dimensional data will take up more than one row/column in a spreadsheet.
