Processing Data Loading Examples
================================

This project contains several examples of how to load data into Processing. The first example shows how to load one-dimensional data from a single text file, the rest show how to load two-dimensional data. 

1. Single text files
2. Multiple text files
2. Multiple text files in an array
3. Single CSV file
4. Single XML file
5. Single JSON file

One-dimensional data is data that can be fit into one column or row in a spreadsheet, two-dimensional data will take up more than one row/column in a spreadsheet. The sample data I'm using is below:
