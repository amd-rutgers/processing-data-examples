Processing Data Loading Examples
================================

This project contains several examples of how to load data into Processing. The first example shows how to load one-dimensional data from a single text file, the rest show how to load two-dimensional data*. 

1. [Single text file](single_txt_file/)
2. [Multiple text files](multiple_txt_files/)
2. [Multiple text files in an array](multiple_txt_files_array/)
3. Single CSV file
4. Single XML file
5. Single JSON file

The sample data I'm using is below:

* One-dimensional data is data that can be fit into one column or row in a spreadsheet, two-dimensional data will take up more than one row/column in a spreadsheet.
